Subject: Thank you – Continued Interest in Your Research

Dear Professor [Last Name],

Thank you for your kind response. I completely understand that you're not taking any students this year.

I greatly admire your work in [insert specific research area or recent paper title], and I will continue to follow your research with interest. If there is ever an opportunity to assist on your projects in any capacity—such as volunteering remotely or contributing to ongoing research—I would be honored to contribute and gain experience, even outside a formal program.

Please keep me in mind if opportunities arise in the future. Thank you again for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,
Syed Zeeshan Ali
