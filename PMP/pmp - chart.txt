    CCB will review the changes and authority to manage the change. 
	input - Risk Report,Work Performance Reports, Change Requests output - Approved Change Requests
	
 1.6. close project
	formal acceptance of deliverables by the customer, if prematurely closed log reasons, Audit project success or failure, Reassigning personnel
	input - Accepted Deliverables output - Final Product, Services, or Result Transition, Final Report

 2.1 plan scope management
	 Prevent Gold Plating, which is doing extra work not in the scope.
	 Prevent Scope creep, which are unauthorized work added to the scope. 
	 input - project charter output - Scope Management Plan 
	 
 2.2. collect requirements 		
	  input -  data gathering, analysis, etc 	  output - Requirements Documentation , Requirements Traceability Matrix
 
 2.3 define scope 
	 A detailed project scope statement
	 output - Project Scope Statement
	 
 2.4. create wbs
	 t & t - decomposition output - Scope Baseline (3Components)  Project Scope Statement WBS  WBS Dictionary  
	 
 2.5. control scope
	When changes are made and approved, the project baselines will need to be adjusted to reflect these changes. diret adding refer to scope creep. 
	input - work performance data output - work performance report, change requests

 3.1 plan schedule management
		output - Schedule Management Plan
		
 3.2. define activities
      output - Project Management Plan Updates,  Activity List, Activity Attributes, Milestone List, Change Requests
	  
 3.3. sequence activities
     t & t - Precedence Diagramming Method,  Dependency Determination and Integration,  Leads and Lags  
	 output - Project Schedule Network Diagrams
	 
 3.4 estimate activity duration 
	t&t - Analogous Estimating - (top-down), Parametric Estimating, Three-Point Estimates, Bottom-Up Estimating ( very detailed ) 
		 Three Point Estimate -  (O+P+4M)/6.  If the Optimistic is 8 days, Pessimistic is 14 days, and Most likely is 10 days, Pert is 10.333.
		 Standard Deviation (P-O)/6 Triangle Distribution
		 The Triangle Distribution formula is (O+R+P)/3

	Tuckman’s Ladder, (Five Stages)
		 Forming  People getting to know one another
		 Storming Speaking about issues on the project
		 Norming  Coming to a solution to issues
		 Performing Doing the work
		 Adjourning Team is release

  6.5. manage team
	t&t - Interpersonal and Team Skills
	output - change request
	
	Problem Solving (confronting) Let’s put our heads together, study the problem and find the best solution. 	Win-Win
	Forcing Bob’s got priority here, so we’ll go with his opinion on the solution. 	Win-Lose
	Compromising Let’s take a little of both sides of the arguments and create a mixed solution.  	Lose-Lose
	Smoothing It’s really not that big of a problem. Can be considered a Lose-Lose
	Withdrawal I’m leaving. Do whatever solution works. The conflict is not resolved and it is considered a Yield-Lose solution
